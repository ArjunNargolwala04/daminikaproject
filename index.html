            <p>Dear Daminika,</p>
            <p>You are the love of my life, my one and only, my baby. 
                I love you more than anything else on earth, and I am so so so very thankful thankful that you are in my life.
            I couldn't live without you, and there is no one else in the universe I'd rather laugh, smile, and spend time with. 
            I have the biggest crush on you (rawr) and you make me complete. I hope you come to this website a million times a day,   
            and even then, you wouldn't come close the number of times I think of you and miss you.</p>
